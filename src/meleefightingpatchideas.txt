Changing to Melee Fighting, Adding a new Skill
• getSkillType of melee implementation
    • if any of those cases return SKILL_MELEEFIGHTING 
    • This will make that skill go up on any weapon_melee type found
• getWeaponSkill
    • finds the weapon type, matches it to a skill, returns said skill's lvl
    • modify so all melee cases return melee_fighting skill
• Create a skill called melee fighting

Adding new WEAPON_TYPES
• const.h
    • enum list of all weapon types
• luascript.cpp
    • registerEnum weapon type
    • luaCreateWeapon->case list, include it so it gets the right melee, dist, wand treatment
• spells.cpp
    • if the weapon_type will be required by a spell to use, need to include here
• tools.cpp
    • getWeaponName returns the name of the weapon
    • where is the reverse of this? lua? 


Nautral Gear Stats
• items.cpp has a list of itemparseattributes of all stats given by xml with attribute names
• items.cpp then parsesthis info and attaches it to each item as an ability
• weaponoritem->abilities.skills[SKILL_SWORD] i think is how it is used
• can use this to include it in calculations
• both weapons and armour if equipped
